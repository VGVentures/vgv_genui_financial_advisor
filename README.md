## Features

- **AI Financial Advisor** — chat-powered insights using Firebase AI and structured output via [Dartantic](https://github.com/brianegan/dartantic)
- **Generative UI** — AI responses rendered as interactive Flutter widgets (charts, tables, chips) via [GenUI](https://github.com/flutter/genui)
- **Dashboard** — sparkline cards, portfolio overview, and responsive layouts
- **Feature Flags** — runtime toggles backed by shared preferences
- **Rive Animations** — loading screens and thinking indicators

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [FVM](https://fvm.app/) (Flutter Version Management)
- [FlutterFire CLI](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli) for Firebase configuration

### Install Flutter SDK

```sh
fvm install
```

### Firebase Setup

This project requires a Firebase project with **Firebase AI** and **App Check** enabled. Config files are not committed to the repo — generate them with:

```sh
flutterfire configure
```

This creates `lib/firebase_options.dart`, `android/app/google-services.json`, and the platform-specific plist files.

### Run the App

```sh
# Development
fvm flutter run --target lib/main_development.dart

# Production
fvm flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

To enable App Check with reCAPTCHA (web builds):

```sh
fvm flutter run --target lib/main_development.dart --dart-define=RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_key_here
```

_Works on iOS, Android, Web, macOS, and Windows._

## Architecture

The app follows a **feature-first** structure with [BLoC](https://bloclibrary.dev/) for state management:

```
lib/
  app/             — App shell, theme, presentation tokens
  advisor/         — AI chat experience (Bloc, catalog items, GenUI)
  core/            — Shared repositories (error reporting, feature flags)
  dashboard/       — Portfolio dashboard and sparkline cards
  feature_flag/    — Feature flag cubit and dev menu
  onboarding/      — Intro and profile selection screens
```

Key dependencies:
- **firebase_ai** — Gemini model access via Firebase
- **genui** — Renders structured AI output as Flutter widgets
- **flutter_bloc** — State management
- **dartantic_ai / dartantic_firebase_ai** — Structured output schemas for AI

## Running Tests

```sh
fvm dart run very_good_cli:very_good test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the coverage report:

```sh
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/
open coverage/index.html
```

## Bloc Lints

This project uses [bloc_lint](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc_lint) to enforce best practices.

```sh
fvm dart run bloc_tools:bloc lint .
```

You can also validate with VSCode using the [official bloc extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FelixAngelov.bloc).

---

## Translations

This project uses [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide][internationalization_link].

Add strings to `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`, then regenerate:

```sh
fvm flutter gen-l10n --arb-dir="lib/l10n/arb"
```

Or just run the app — code generation happens automatically.
